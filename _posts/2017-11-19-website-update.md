Hey everyone. I've been focused on school and work related matters recently, so I haven't had much time to work on the blog. Before I was about to start blogging, I realized I needed to make some changes to the website.

The main feature that I added to the website was a **work** page. I listed links to my Github, LinkedIn, and Product Hunt page. In addition, I also wrote an excerpt for notable projects that I have worked and am currently working on.

## Next Steps

The next features that will be added to the website will be a **category** and **archive** page.

The category page is for organizing my several blog posts and content more effectively.

The archive page is needed because I still have quite a bit of blog posts from Medium that I need to move over.
