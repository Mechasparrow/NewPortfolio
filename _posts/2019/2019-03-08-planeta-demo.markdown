I just finished up the first demo version of Planeta. It is a space puzzle game where you are trying to get back to his home planet.

You can download the demo here: [https://mechasparrow.itch.io/planeta](https://mechasparrow.itch.io/planeta)

# How the game came about

I was assigned a project in my technology class to design a video game. I was also taking AP Physics 1 at the same time, so I decided to try to make a game that had to do with physics and space.

Initially, I tried to model the game off of real world gravitation physics. Two weeks before the game demo, I pivoted that game mechanic towards having fixed gravitational fields.

I also used to play Mario Galaxy when I was very young, so I decided I should make something that had to do with jumping from planet to planet.
