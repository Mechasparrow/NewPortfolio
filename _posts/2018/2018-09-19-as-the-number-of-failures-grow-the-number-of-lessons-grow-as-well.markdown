Well, I guess my writing is becoming very yin/yang in nature. Hopefully next week, they will have a bit more spice to them :)

Shall we talk about failure?

## We all will fail at something.

There is no human I know of where everything in his life went according to plan. There is no way of knowing all the circumstances of the situation until the situation has arises. The only thing we know of for sure is the present. From the present, we see tiny portions of the past and potential futures. However, we will fail at something every day. Whether it is a large or small thing.

We will fail.

**but**

## We will learn and grow.

Yes. We will fail, but it is nothing to get super upset about. The sun will set like it has billions of years before. Tomorrow will be a new day.

However, we will be different. We have encountered a failure, a mistake, an error. As such, we are slightly wiser then we were the day previous. This is only if we give the failure the appropriate amount of care and attention necessary to internalize the experience as a lesson.

As long as we look at varying degrees of failure and mistakes as opportunities for growth, we become more confident and adventurous people.
