Well.

Kindness is the result of understanding that we all live in the same world and breath the same air.

Hatred is the result of a misunderstanding how things actually are and drawing artificial lines between people and others.

It is very easy to be hateful and very hard to be kind.

However, kindness does not mean being nice. It does not mean following the script written by society.

Kindness means that you are honest and understanding as much as you can be in any moment.

-- Michael Navazhylau
