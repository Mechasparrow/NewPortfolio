I recently completed reading Viktor Frankl's _Man's Search for Meaning_

It was a fascinating book. There were things that were described that almost seemed counter-intuitive but made sense after a second read through. If there is any quote that has been stuck with me from reading the book, it would have to be

> Live as if you were living a second time, and as though you had acted wrongly the first time.  
> -- Viktor Frankl

When this is taken into consideration, many things that were once considered large stresses or small nuisances evaporate. Of course, it's not all of them, but it's a dramatically different mindset and commands a higher level of awareness in one's life.

It carries great strength when considered under the context of great change. In the face of change, we may feel a great deal of anxiety and fear. If we expand this fear and anxiety into an entire life, we find that the only way forward is through this fear regardless. It will come to pass, but it only will if we take the leap of faith.

Really take the time to understand and ponder this statement. Who knows if it may carry deep meaning to you as well.
