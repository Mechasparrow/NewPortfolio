Hello again. A couple weeks back, I got hired at this wonderful place called the [TheCoderSchool](https://www.thecoderschool.com/). It's this place where kids from all ages can learn how to code.

We usually teach younger kids Scratch and then move on to more advanced programming languages like JavaScript, Python, etc.

So here are some of the key things I've picked up so far from teaching.

# Get to Know your Student

When it comes to teaching one on one, it is important to establish trust with the student. If you try teaching the kid something without knowing anything about them, it will be hard to teach the material in a way that the student finds useful.

For example, if a student likes video games, you would teach the material in relation to video games. Expanding on this example, you could have creating a video game as a project that ties in the knowledge being obtained in the lessons.

# Be Patient.

Every person learns differently and at different rates. For some people, they can pick up concepts within the first hour of learning it. For others, it may take several iterations of practice before it finally clicks into place.

Age also plays a key factor. Younger kids often have a shorter attention span, so they require more patience to deal with.

# Be Kind and Break the Ice

When you receive a new student, they don't really know what to expect. Initially, your just a stranger to them.

Try to make small jokes and don't be afraid to laugh at your mistakes. They will surely laugh along too.

Also just remember to be kind. Have it so you teaching them is something they look forward to. Not something that is just part of the routine.

Well, those are some of the things I've learned so far. I'll update more often as interesting things come up.

I'll also be heading to [GlobalHack](https://globalhack.org/) next weekend, so look forward to seeing a blog about that.
