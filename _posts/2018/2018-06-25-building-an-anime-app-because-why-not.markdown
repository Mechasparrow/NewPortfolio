## Why
So one day, I was watching Anime. I do this on a frequent basis. With that being the case, I realized at some point that there was so much anime that I was losing track of. I looked at the current implementation out there... mainly [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net), but I thought I should build something a bit more extendable. There were a couple features and aesthetics that I wanted to modify. Not only that, I also have a set of favorate characters(A.K.A Waifus) that I thought would be cool to add in too. There is also a collection for this called [MyWaifuList](https://mywaifulist.moe/)

## Stack
The stack as of right now is just Angular 6.0 with TypeScript and Web Browser Storage. As I further develop the app. I'll probably off load some of the logic onto a backend server of some sort.

## Features
- Profile Page (WIP)
- Anime Search
- Waifu showcase
- Anime/Entertainment collection Page
- [In Progress Features](https://github.com/Mechasparrow/Animku/issues)

## exit()
