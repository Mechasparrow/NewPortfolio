We all have commitments. Commitments that are mandatory and commitments that are optional.

We may carry the commitment of school, work, family, etc.
These are types of commitments that could be considered mandatory.

However, there are the optional ones.
After-School clubs, meetups, hanging out with friends, etc

Depending on our value systems, we may place a very high or low priority on these commitments.

But..

If you don't leave any slack in your life, how can you truly dedicate yourself to the commitments that are necessary to uphold?

Don't be afraid to cut away these extraneous commitments. You can always come back to things when you feel like you can actually balance them.

Commitments can't be balanced in the first place if you don't have the time to plan and organize in the first place.

In that case, set aside at least an hour a week to look at all your commitments and plan things around accordingly. A schedule helps.

So that's that.
