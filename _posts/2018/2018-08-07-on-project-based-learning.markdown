I really enjoy working on projects. Especially the ones that allow for creative freedom. When a problem is presented, we are either told by someone else how it is solved, or we are tasked with creating a solution. Often, there can be more than one solution to a problem. I find that incredible.

# Retention of information

When a problem is presented, we are required to pull from multiple repositories of information to create a potential solution. Rather then making the excuse, "I don't see myself using this in _real life_", you are given a problem. Go solve it. Oh by the way... Here are some books that might help. Good luck.

By engaging the students in trying to find the solution themselves, they have a greater investment in figuring out what key information they were missing for the solution.

# Diversity of learning

Depending on the scope of the problem presented, an individual has several paths that may lead to the completion of the project. Even if it is pre-structured project, the student/disciple is often given a variety of paths to complete it. This allows each student to pick up knowledge that aids them in the methods of problem solving that they utilize.

# Collaborative efforts

By throwing multiple individuals into a project, a short feedback loop between team members can be established. This allows for incremental improvement and development without the complete fear that what is being built is somewhat viable. That is, of course, if other members choose to speak there mind regarding the project at hand.

# Conclusion

If we want to stay motivated or learning new things, the best way is through the completion of projects or goals. This brings personal meaning behind the knowledge were attaining.
