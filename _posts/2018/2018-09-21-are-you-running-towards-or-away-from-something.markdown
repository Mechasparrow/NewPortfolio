There is something.

Something that we are running from.  
or  
Something that we are running towards.

We tend to run from things that are uncomfortable to think about and run towards things that are comforting.

We may even stop trying to run. This is still running. Running away by not doing. Running away from our potential

Some of us. We may decide to run towards the uncomfortable, the unknown.

It may be scary at times.

But wouldn't you rather run towards something then run away from it?
