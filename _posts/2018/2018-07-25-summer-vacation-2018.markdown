## My 2018 Summer so far

### Oh how different it really was
This summer. This summer has been quite a ride. When I started this summer, I thought that I would spend time just studying computer science and reading math textbooks. Yeah... That's not really how I do "computer science". Maybe next summer, or over the senior year... But definitely not summer.

### Personal Development
For me, summer has always been a time to build new frameworks for sustained growth and progress. It is like the calm before the storm. Its not like nothing happens during summer. There is just more time to think. However, that shouldn't be an excuse not to think when it counts.

And with this summer, this has been never more true. I am entering my final year of high school. Beyond that, college. This creates some uncertainty about the future that most be faced directly and no longer avoided.

### Learned some things
I did learn some concrete things summer, not just spiritual or "life lessons". Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I had a unfulfilled art course requirement that needed to be taken care of. I choose to take care of this by taking an online summer art course over AP Art History. I did not know how much this would change my appreciation for the arts and just art as a whole. Though it was long and tedious, I am glad that I took that course this summer.

I had some social conflicts with some new and old friends. In the process, I learned what I really valued in a friendship and what it means to be supportive and understanding of other peoples lives. By what degree? I can't really say without point of reference

### Programming and Building things again!
In the beginning, I referred to not studying that much computer science. Well I studied a little. Just a couple chapters of a textbook. Instead, most of my time was spent studying new frameworks and tools that I could use to create interesting and useful applications. For the tech nerds out there. I studied React.JS, Redux, React-Native, and some Backend tech. I'll list links to these in the bottom.

I learned these technologies through project-based learning. I'm working on a couple projects right now. For now, just an app and a sort of game with geo-location. I also plan on starting to live stream these and release some tutorials on a semi-consistent basis.

### Teaching
A couple weeks back, I got hired as a programming instructor for a Untitled Learning Center. I also have been creating tutorials for the LiveEdu platform. The skills I pick up in teaching should be helpful in other avenues of life. Who knows?

This has been a long blog post. So I'm going to cut it here. I might go into more detail on specific parts later on. But thats that for now.
