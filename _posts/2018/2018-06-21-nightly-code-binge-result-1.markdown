So with the wonderful amount of time I have allocated during the summer. I get to do some things that I would not normally do on a school day.

Note... It's like one in the morning so...

## HMMM

Hmm indeed. I have been coding something to do with Anime and some other cutesy things. Though anime is a niche, I plan on expanding it onto other stuff. Then I can just integrate with like 5 apis for ex (YouTube, Netflix, SoundCloud, etc.......)

## What did I code today?
Looky here -> [Github Link][37e4b21b]

  [37e4b21b]: https://github.com/Mechasparrow/Animuku "Animuku"

I'll have a prototype out later this week. (I think)

## What will happen tomorrow

Probably more coding.
I'll also start working on my more *serious* app. More detail on that tomorrow

See ya next time.
