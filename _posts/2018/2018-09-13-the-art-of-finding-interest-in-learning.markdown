# Anything can be interesting

Things can be taken in two layers of depth, the surface level and the deep level.

# At Surface Level

At the surface level, things may seem uninteresting. Just off minimal observation, we may find things uninteresting if it does not directly concern us.

# At the deep level

At the deeper level, anything and everything is interesting. Even the simplest things like the observation of a falling apple (Newton) carries the most indefinite of complexities.

Look deeper and find these complexities, and you won't be disappointed.
