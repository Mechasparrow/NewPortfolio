Hello.

## Overview

I'm currently working on this new project called **Alkonost**. It's basically an web app that gives you news from a variety of sources.

I'm building it right now to help diversify my own news reading. **Version 1.0** will have a set amount of connected new feeds and categories.

The initial categories for the app will be

* Tech
* Business
* Sports
* Politics

## The tech

The application is mostly built with the **ionic framework**. It is a useful tool for building mobile web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I highly recommend if you are trying to build hybrid applications.

I also have to write a **RSS parser** in the app. I found a library that does most of the hard work for me. However, there is still some kinks I need to work out.

Most of the tech for this project was built out 2 months back for a tutorial I created. I am repurposing that code and publishing it.

The main issue right now is the exerpts creation. A user should not be able to view the entire article within the app. Instead, they should only be able to view an shortened version.

I will write more regarding this project as it progresses. That's all I have for now.
