## Project Release! Alkonost: Another News Aggregation App

Alright. Alright. What's the project?

TL;DR [link to news app](http://alkonost.surge.sh/)

So recently, I've been kinda annoyed with news stuff. As a result, I've been working on a news aggregation app in my free time.

It's called **Alkonost**. You can use it [here](http://alkonost.surge.sh/)

### What does it do?

Well right now. Not much.

Currently I have it setup to read some news from a select set of newsfeeds and categories. The categories are as follows

* Business
* Tech
* Entertainment
* Art and Culture
* Lifestyle
* Politics

I hope to implement more customizability in later versions.

### Features to Implement
Here is the current list of features that I plan to implement for next release.

* Add custom rss feeds
* Add custom categories
* Delete rss feeds

There is definitely a ton more I wish to implement, but I need to have a goal in my sights :P

### Important Bugs

The current version of the app works. However, there are a couple of bugs. The main one is that

> You can't pull up the newsfeeds too quickly

What this means is that by switching between different news categories too quickly it could cause the app to glitch out.
