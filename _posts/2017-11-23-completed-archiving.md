Just today I completed the medium archiving process. You can now view the archives at

[/archive](/archive)

## How did I implement it?

I went over to medium. There I downloaded an archive of all my posts I wrote. They were saved as pure HTML files.

I put them all into a folder labeled "archive"

I then created a page that iterates through each page and links to it.

**bad news**: They are still pure HTML files :(

`I would still mark it as an success`

Please be sure to check out the archived posts at
