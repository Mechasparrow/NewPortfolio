I recently stated that I would be moving off Medium and writing mainly on my personal website.

Main issue with this though is I have quite a bit of stories on Medium.

## Solution?

So the solution to this is pretty simple actually. Medium allows writers to download a zipped archive of all their posts.

I will just have to create a page on a website that links to all archived posts. They will be viewed as unstyled HTML webpages.

I'm sorry :P

That's it for now on this piece of development. I will update about this once it is completed.
